# Hands-on

## Context-Aware Help

Trying to help someone over the phone vs. helping someone at the computer

![Young Thug and Lil Durk Troubleshooting meme - imgflip](imgs/atcomputer.jpeg)

## Contex-Aware Help

- Ask the chatbot in the ~~browser~~ IDE
- ~~Copy~~ Apply the response ~~and paste it~~ in R
- ~~Share the errors or output with the chat~~
- ~~Repeat (and potentially introduce errors)~~

### Bridging R and LLMs

-   Robust and designed specifically for easy interaction with LLMs directly from R

-   Broad provider support and meant for entreprise/production use

-   Allows models to extend their capabilities by executing R code

### Bridging R and LLMs

-   Can produce output that is immediately usable in R

-   Leverages the btw package to 'see' the R session

-   Strong dev team

## `gander`

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"} 
- More than a simple chat window 
- Powered by `ellmer`
- RStudio & Positron
::::
:::::

gander receives a snapshot of our environment with every request and recognizes what we are talking about, including object and variable names

## gander demo

We use ellmer to specify which model powers the addin (and optionally set a system prompt).  

Today we can use openAI or Anthropic models. 

- use with `ctr+alt+G`

`ganderDemo.R`


Setup instructions for Positron [here](https://simonpcouch.github.io/gander/index.html)

## `ellmer` demo


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(ellmer)
my_chat <- chat_openai() 
my_chat
```

<br/>
Chat with the model then look at your chat object again

<br/>
Create a new chat object with a different model and system prompt

## Interacting with the chat object

Without leaving R:

</br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### In the R console 

`live_console(my_chat)`

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### In our web browser

`live_browser(my_chat)`
