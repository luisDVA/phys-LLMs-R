## Project-oriented workflow

*Project*: A folder on your computer that holds all the files relevant to a particular piece of work. We usually separate:

📁 Data\
📁 Scripts\
📁 Outputs\

## Projects

-   Efficient and organized workflows
-   Relative file paths and working directories
-   **Safer and cheaper approach when using AI assistants**

## IDEs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### RStudio

-   Familiar and trusted
-   AI tools available (fewer GUI options)
-   Not going anywhere
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Positron

-   Extensible
-   Built-in LLM tools
-   Constant development
-   Alternatives available

# IDE tour and setup

We'll use cloud-based models for this course. More on this later.

## Application Programming Interfaces

- The rules and protocols that determine how one application can request data from another.
- Let different software systems talk to each other and exchange data without having to understand each others' inner workings.

## APIs

Allow applications (R scripts, browser-based prompts, mobile apps) to:

-   Send input text (prompts)
-   Receive generated text, code, or structured data back
-   Handle authentication (e.g., using API keys)

## API Keys

Working with APIs means we need to identify ourselves to the model provider and authenticate our encrypted connection to their servers

</br>

#### Overall workflow

-   Create and account with a model provider
-   💳 ?
-   Generate an API key
-   Keep it safe but reachable by your LLM tools

## 

### In R

Most packages work with keys stored in Environment Variables.

### In GUI-based assistants

We enter our keys interactively

</br>

⚠️ Never share API keys in public repositories, network drives, shared documents or screen recordings.

## API key setup

We'll provide keys for two popular providers. These will only be active during the course hours.

### R

Temporary: `Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "api_key")` (quoted)

Permanent: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`
